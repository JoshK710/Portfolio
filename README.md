Personal Website: https://joshk710.github.io
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/JoshK710/JoshK710.github.io.git

My personal website has a card that talks a little bit about me and my background. I also have sections that include resume information, hobbies, and other projects that I've worked on.
This project uses vanilla html, javascript, and foundation css. Additionally, I used a trick where GitHub will host a website on GitHub pages if the name of the project folder is the same
as the repository. This was one of the first projects that I worked on in my web development class and I learned a lot from trying to play around with different layouts using css.

Dynamic Web Server: https://admirable-trees.onrender.com
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/JoshK710/dynamic-webserver

This dynamic webserver is hosted on render.com so the first link is how to access the project, however, the link takes time to load because I opted for the cheapest version of hosting 
services. This project used an sqlite database from a dataset based on women's empowerment and global gender parity and is about keeping track of equality for women in different countries. The goal of the project
was to display various data points of countries by filtering the dataset based on different variables. These variables included: Women's Empowerment Group, Global Gender Parity Group, and
Sustainable Development Goal Region. The last variable shows different regions on a map of the world and filters data based on the particular region one is looking at. Women's empowerment
and Gender Parity is important for the future so that women are treated better. Particular countries still have inequalities related to gender which really get in the way of that countries
development. There are also disparities in the indices of women's empowerment and gender parity since there are some examples of countries with high women's empowerment indices but low
gender parity indicies. This is just one observation to think about when considering a country's development based on the beliefs women hold about their future in general. 

Single Page Crime in St Paul Application: https://github.com/indawgnito/webdev-rest

Lastly, I linked the github repository for a single page application based off a dataset of crimes in and around west Saint Paul. The README file for the repository should have instructions
on how to run the project on a local machine. This project utilizes vue.js and foundation css. It's similar to the previous project in the way that it uses a dataset and a rest server
to query data from an sqlite database. Additionally, it has an about us section that talks about me and a couple of my group members who worked on the project with me. Overall, I learned
a lot about collaboration and web development through working on this project.
